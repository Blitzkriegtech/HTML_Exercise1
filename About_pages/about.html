                <br><p>The male`s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies
                    <br>between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking;
                    <br> it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back, head, neck, 
                    <br>and shoulders and continuing on the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly.
